# Beep Boop

## By Krista Rutz.  _Last updated: 01/24/2020_

This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number, with some exciting exceptions.

### Description

This web application allows the user to enter a number from 0 to 1000. It then prints a list of the numbers from 0 to the user's chosen number, inclusive. However, certain rules replace numbers containing the digits 1, 2, or 3 with _"Beep!"_, _"Boop!"_, and _"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."_, respectively.

### Objectives
Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

- JavaScript business logic and user interface logic are separate.  
- Variable names are descriptive and use lower camel case (e.g. myVariableExample).
- Code is clean, well-refactored, and easy-to-read. This includes correct indendation, spacing, and including only necessary comments and debugging tools.
- Application implements a loop and works as expected.
- All previous objectives have been met.
- Logic is broken down into "plain English" specs, listed in README.
- Project is in a presentable, portfolio-quality state.
- Required functionality is in place by Friday deadline.
- Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
#### PAST Standards
- Commits are made regularly with clear messages that finish the phrase "It willâ€¦".
- Project README that includes, bare minimum:
  - author name
  - program name
  - detailed setup instructions
  - description
  - copyright and license information
